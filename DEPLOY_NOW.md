You've completed:
- ‚úÖ Step 1: Got JSON key from service account
- ‚úÖ Step 2: Added 4 GitHub secrets
- ‚úÖ Step 3: Created/checked Artifact Registry

**You're ready to deploy!**

---

## Step 4: Trigger Deployment

You have **2 options**:

### Option A: Manual Trigger (Recommended - You Control It)

1. **Go to GitHub Actions:**
   - Open: https://github.com/dquillman/MSS/actions

2. **Select the Workflow:**
   - In left sidebar, click **"Build and Deploy to Google Cloud Run"**

3. **Run Workflow:**
   - Click **"Run workflow"** button (top right, purple button)
   - **Branch:** Select **`master`**
   - Click green **"Run workflow"** button

4. **Watch Progress:**
   - A new workflow run will appear (yellow circle = running)
   - **Click on it** to see detailed progress
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for completion

5. **Get Your URL:**
   - When workflow completes, scroll to **"Get service URL"** step
   - You'll see: `Service deployed at: https://mss-api-XXXXX-uc.a.run.app`
   - **Copy that URL!**

---

### Option B: Auto-Trigger (I Can Push Code)

I can push a commit to trigger the deployment automatically.

**Tell me "yes" and I'll push to trigger it!**

## Step 5: Verify Deployment

Once deployment completes:

### A. Test Health Endpoint
1. Open: `https://YOUR-URL/healthz`
2. Should see:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "service": "MSS API",
     "version": "5.5.7"
   }
   ```

### B. Test Authentication
1. Go to: `https://YOUR-URL/auth`
2. Try creating a new account
3. Try logging in

### C. Test Studio
1. Go to: `https://YOUR-URL/studio`
2. Should load the MSS Studio interface

## What to Expect

### Workflow Steps (You'll See):
1. ‚úÖ Checkout code
2. ‚úÖ Set up Python
3. ‚úÖ Authenticate to Google Cloud
4. ‚è≥ Build Docker image (3-5 minutes)
5. ‚è≥ Push Docker image (1-2 minutes)
6. ‚è≥ Deploy to Cloud Run (2-3 minutes)
7. ‚úÖ Get service URL
8. ‚úÖ Health check

**Total time: 5-10 minutes**

---

## If Deployment Fails

### Common Issues:

**"Failed to authenticate"**
- Check `GCP_SA_KEY` secret - make sure JSON is complete
- Verify service account email is correct

**"Artifact Registry not found"**
- Check repository `mss` exists in `us-central1`
- Verify you're using the right project

**"Cloud Run deployment failed"**
- Check service account has "Cloud Run Admin" role
- Verify project ID is correct

**"Health check failed"**
- Check logs in Cloud Run console
- Verify `/healthz` endpoint exists (we verified this!)

---

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
- ‚úÖ Workflow shows green checkmark
- ‚úÖ "Get service URL" step shows a URL
- ‚úÖ `/healthz` endpoint returns version 5.5.7
- ‚úÖ You can access `/auth` and `/studio` pages

---

## Ready?

**Choose your path:**
- **Option A:** Go to GitHub Actions and click "Run workflow" (you control it)
- **Option B:** Tell me to push code to trigger automatically

Either way works! üöÄ
