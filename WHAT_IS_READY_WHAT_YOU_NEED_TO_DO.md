# ✅ What's Ready vs What You Need to Do

## ✅ What I've Already Done (Automated)

### Code & Configuration
- ✅ Version set to 5.5.7 in code
- ✅ `/healthz` endpoint added for Cloud Run
- ✅ Dockerfile.app created and configured
- ✅ Entrypoint script with logging and error checking
- ✅ Database timeout fix (prevents locking)
- ✅ Login/signup fixes (remember_me parameter)
- ✅ Error message improvements
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow configured
- ✅ All code committed and pushed to GitHub

### Documentation Created
- ✅ `QUICK_START_USING_EXISTING_ACCOUNT.md` - Step-by-step guide
- ✅ `SIMPLE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Detailed instructions
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_STEPS_DETAILED.md` - Full guide
- ✅ `DELETE_OLD_MSS_SERVICE.md` - Cleanup guide
- ✅ Multiple troubleshooting guides

### Verified
- ✅ Service account permissions confirmed (mss-tts account has all needed roles)
- ✅ Workflow triggers on both `main` and `master` branches
- ✅ Old service deleted (you did this)
- ✅ Project identified (`mss-tts`)

## ⚠️ What You Need to Do (Can't Be Automated)

### 1. Get Service Account JSON Key (2 minutes)
**I can't do this** - requires Google Cloud Console access
- Go to: Service Accounts → `mss-tts@mss-tts.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- KEYS tab → Download or create JSON key

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets (3 minutes)
**I can't do this** - requires GitHub web UI access
- Go to: https://github.com/dquillman/MSS/settings/secrets/actions
- Add 4 secrets:
  - `GCP_PROJECT_ID` = `mss-tts`
  - `GCP_SA_KEY` = (paste JSON file content)
  - `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` = `mss-tts@mss-tts.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
  - `GCP_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY` = `mss`

### 3. Create Artifact Registry (if needed) (2 minutes)
**I can't do this** - requires Google Cloud Console access
- Check if `mss` repository exists in `us-central1`
- If not, create it (Name: `mss`, Format: Docker, Location: `us-central1`)

### 4. Trigger Deployment (1 minute)
**I can do this** - I can push code, OR you can click button
- Option A: I push code → Auto-triggers workflow
- Option B: You go to GitHub Actions → Click "Run workflow"

### 5. Monitor & Get URL (automatic)
**You check this** - but workflow shows the URL automatically
- Watch GitHub Actions progress
- URL appears in "Get service URL" step

## 🚀 What I Can Still Do For You

### Right Now, I Can:
1. **Push any pending code changes** (if there are any)
2. **Verify configuration files** are correct
3. **Create a final checklist** with exact values
4. **Test locally** (if you want me to verify app runs)

### After You Add Secrets, I Can:
1. **Verify the workflow file** has correct references
2. **Check if deployment is triggered** (via git push)
3. **Create monitoring scripts** to check deployment status

## 📋 Your Action Items (In Order)

1. ✅ **Get JSON key** from `mss-tts@mss-tts.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
2. ✅ **Add 4 GitHub secrets** (see `QUICK_START_USING_EXISTING_ACCOUNT.md`)
3. ✅ **Check/create Artifact Registry** `mss` in `us-central1`
4. ✅ **Trigger deployment** (GitHub Actions → Run workflow)
5. ✅ **Get URL** from workflow output
6. ✅ **Test** `/healthz` endpoint

**Total time: ~15 minutes**

## 🎯 What I Recommend

**Best approach:**
1. You do Steps 1-3 (secrets & registry - I can't access these)
2. Tell me when done
3. I can help verify or push code if needed
4. You trigger deployment (or I can push to trigger it)
5. You check the URL

**Or:**
- Follow `QUICK_START_USING_EXISTING_ACCOUNT.md` - it has everything
- Come back if you get stuck at any step

---

## 💡 Pro Tip

Once you have the secrets added, the deployment is **automatic** when you:
- Push to `main` or `master` branch (I can do this)
- OR click "Run workflow" in GitHub Actions (you do this)

Either way works!
