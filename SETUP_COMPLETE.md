# ✅ Server Setup Complete!

## Flask-Limiter Installed ✅

The missing dependency `flask-limiter` has been installed successfully!

---

## 🚀 Start the Server

Now you can start the server:

```powershell
cd web
python api_server.py
```

**Wait for:**
```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

## 🌐 Access the Pages

Once server is running, open in browser:

- **Auth Page:** `http://localhost:5000/auth`
- **Studio:** `http://localhost:5000/studio`
- **Dashboard:** `http://localhost:5000/dashboard`
- **Workflow:** `http://localhost:5000/workflow`

---

## ⚠️ Note About Other Dependencies

Some packages failed to install due to disk space:
- `google-cloud-storage`
- `gunicorn`
- `imageio-ffmpeg`

**These are optional** for basic testing. The server should start without them for:
- Authentication testing ✅
- Mobile responsiveness testing ✅
- Exception handling testing ✅
- Rate limiting testing ✅

If you need full functionality later, free up disk space and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ✅ Ready to Test!

1. ✅ Flask-Limiter installed
2. ✅ Server should start
3. ✅ Routes should work
4. ✅ Ready to test improvements!
