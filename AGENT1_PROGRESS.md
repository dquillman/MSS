# Agent 1: Security & Infrastructure - Progress Report

**Started:** 2025-01-XX
**Status:** ‚úÖ IN PROGRESS

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Security Audit & Fixes

- [x] **SQL Query Audit** - Verified all queries in `database.py` use parameterized queries (‚úÖ All safe)
- [x] **CORS Configuration Fixed** - Restricted to allowed origins only
  - Default: empty (fails safe) in production
  - Development: localhost origins allowed
  - Production: Requires explicit `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var
- [x] **HTTPS Enforcement** - Added middleware to redirect HTTP to HTTPS in production
- [x] **Security Headers** - Added comprehensive security headers:
  - HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security)
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - Referrer-Policy
  - Permissions-Policy
- [x] **Secure Cookies** - Configured:
  - SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE (HTTPS only in production)
  - SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY (no JavaScript access)
  - SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE (CSRF protection)
- [x] **File Validation Utilities** - Created `web/utils/file_validation.py`:
  - `validate_image_file()` - Validates image uploads
  - `validate_video_file()` - Validates video uploads
  - `sanitize_filename()` - Prevents directory traversal
  - File size limits enforced
  - Magic bytes verification
- [x] **Upload Endpoint Secured** - Updated `/upload-logo-to-library` with validation
- [x] **Environment Template** - Created `.env.example` with security best practices

---

## ‚úÖ File Upload Security Complete

- [x] `/upload-intro-outro-file` - Secured with video/audio validation
- [x] `/upload-logo-to-library` - Secured with image validation  
- [x] `/api/upload/video` - Secured with video validation
- [x] `/api/upload/thumbnail` - Secured with image validation

**Note:** `/api/platforms/upload/youtube` and `/api/platforms/upload/tiktok` are for uploading TO platforms (OAuth/publishing), not file uploads - these are secure.

All file upload endpoints now have:
- ‚úÖ File type validation (extension + magic bytes)
- ‚úÖ File size limits enforced
- ‚úÖ Filename sanitization (prevents directory traversal)
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling with FileUploadError
- ‚úÖ File verification after save

---

## üìã Remaining Tasks

### Phase 2: Enhanced Input Validation
- [ ] Create pydantic models for all POST endpoints
- [ ] Add validation to remaining upload endpoints
- [ ] Create input sanitization utilities

### Phase 3: Token & Credential Security
- [ ] Create encryption utilities (`web/utils/encryption.py`)
- [ ] Encrypt OAuth tokens before database storage
- [ ] Create migration script for existing tokens
- [ ] Add token rotation mechanism

### Phase 4: Security Monitoring
- [ ] Create security event logging
- [ ] Implement IP-based blocking for brute force
- [ ] Add security audit log endpoint (admin only)

---

## üìù Files Modified

1. `web/api_server.py`
   - CORS configuration restricted
   - HTTPS enforcement middleware
   - Security headers middleware
   - Secure cookie configuration
   - Logo upload endpoint secured

2. `web/utils/file_validation.py` (NEW)
   - File validation utilities
   - Security helpers

3. `.env.example` (NEW)
   - Security configuration template

---

## üîí Security Improvements Summary

### Before:
- ‚ùå CORS allowed all origins
- ‚ùå No HTTPS enforcement
- ‚ùå No security headers
- ‚ùå Insecure cookie configuration
- ‚ùå File uploads not validated
- ‚ùå No filename sanitization

### After:
- ‚úÖ CORS restricted to allowed origins
- ‚úÖ HTTPS enforced in production
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive security headers
- ‚úÖ Secure cookie configuration
- ‚úÖ File validation utilities created
- ‚úÖ Logo upload endpoint secured
- ‚úÖ Filename sanitization implemented

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Production Deployment:**
   - Must set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
   - Must set `ENCRYPTION_KEY` for token encryption (when implemented)
   - Ensure `FLASK_ENV=production` for security features

2. **Development:**
   - Security features are relaxed for local development
   - HTTPS redirect disabled in development mode
   - Localhost origins allowed for CORS

3. **Next Steps:**
   - Complete remaining file upload endpoint security
   - Implement token encryption
   - Add security monitoring

**Next Review:** After completing remaining upload endpoints
