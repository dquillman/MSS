# Getting Started Guide: MSS Agent Coordination

Welcome! This guide will help you get started with coordinating 3 agents working on the MSS project.

---

## 📋 What You Have Now

You've been set up with:

1. **Agent Task Lists** (3 files):
   - `AGENT1_TASKS.md` - Security & Infrastructure tasks
   - `AGENT2_TASKS.md` - Code Quality & Refactoring tasks  
   - `AGENT3_TASKS.md` - Features & Enhancements tasks

2. **Agent Coordination Dashboard**:
   - `web/topic-picker-standalone/agent-dashboard.html` - Visual progress tracker

3. **Work Division Plan**:
   - `AGENT_WORK_DIVISION.md` - Overall strategy and coordination

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Choose Your Path)

### Option A: I'm Working Alone (One Agent at a Time)

**Recommended for beginners or solo work:**

1. **Start with Agent 1** (Security fixes - highest priority)
   ```bash
   # Open Agent 1's task list
   code AGENT1_TASKS.md
   
   # Or view in browser/editor
   ```

2. **Work through tasks sequentially**
   - Check off tasks as you complete them
   - Track time spent
   - Move to Agent 2 tasks after Agent 1 is done

3. **Use the dashboard to track progress**
   - Open `agent-dashboard.html` in browser
   - Check off completed tasks
   - See your progress visually

### Option B: I Have 3 Developers/Agents

**For team coordination:**

1. **Assign agents:**
   - **Agent 1:** Security specialist (can start immediately)
   - **Agent 2:** Backend developer (must wait for Agent 1)
   - **Agent 3:** Frontend developer (can start immediately)

2. **Share task files:**
   - Give each agent their respective `AGENT#_TASKS.md` file
   - Share the dashboard link

3. **Track progress:**
   - Each agent works on their tasks
   - Use dashboard to see overall progress
   - Coordinate via daily standups

### Option C: I'm Using AI Agents (Claude/Cursor)

**For AI-assisted development:**

1. **Create separate conversations/sessions:**
   - **Session 1:** "You are Agent 1 - Security Specialist. Work through AGENT1_TASKS.md"
   - **Session 2:** "You are Agent 2 - Code Quality Specialist. Wait for Agent 1 to complete security fixes"
   - **Session 3:** "You are Agent 3 - Features Specialist. Work independently"

2. **Share context:**
   - Share the relevant task file with each agent
   - Share the dashboard for progress tracking
   - Reference codebase files as needed

## 📖 Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Understand the Project Structure

```bash
# Your MSS project structure:
MSS/
├── web/
│   ├── api_server.py      # Main Flask app (6,400+ lines)
│   ├── database.py        # Database functions
│   └── topic-picker-standalone/
│       └── agent-dashboard.html  # Dashboard here
├── scripts/               # CLI tools
├── AGENT1_TASKS.md        # Agent 1 tasks
├── AGENT2_TASKS.md        # Agent 2 tasks
├── AGENT3_TASKS.md        # Agent 3 tasks
└── AGENT_WORK_DIVISION.md # Overview
```

### Step 2: Open the Dashboard

**Option 1: Via Flask Server (if running)**
```bash
# Start Flask server
cd web
python api_server.py

# Open in browser:
http://localhost:5000/agent-dashboard.html
```

**Option 2: Direct File Open**
```bash
# Just open the HTML file:
web/topic-picker-standalone/agent-dashboard.html
```

### Step 3: Choose Your Starting Point

#### 🟢 Start Here if You're New:
**Agent 1 - Phase 1, Task 1: Security Audit**

1. Open `AGENT1_TASKS.md`
2. Find "Phase 1: Security Audit & SQL Injection Fixes"
3. Read the first task: "Audit SQL Queries in `web/database.py`"
4. Follow the instructions in the task list
5. Check off the task in the dashboard when done

#### 🟡 Or Start with Quick Wins:
**Agent 3 - Frontend Improvements**

1. Open `AGENT3_TASKS.md`
2. Look for "Quick Wins" section
3. Start with "Loading states" (2 hours)
4. Immediate UX improvement, no dependencies

---

## 🛠️ How to Work with Tasks

### For Each Task:

1. **Read the task description** in the task file
2. **Check dependencies** - can you start now?
3. **Review code examples** provided in task files
4. **Make changes** to the codebase
5. **Test your changes**
6. **Check off in dashboard** when complete

### Example Workflow:

```bash
# 1. Open task file
code AGENT1_TASKS.md

# 2. Read task 1.1: "Audit SQL Queries"
# 3. Open the file mentioned
code web/database.py

# 4. Search for SQL queries
# Look for: .execute() calls

# 5. Make fixes
# Fix parameterized queries

# 6. Test
python -m pytest tests/  # If tests exist

# 7. Check off in dashboard
# Open agent-dashboard.html → Check checkbox
```

## 📊 Tracking Progress

### Daily Checklist:

- [ ] Open dashboard
- [ ] Review tasks for today
- [ ] Check off completed tasks
- [ ] Export progress (backup)
- [ ] Review dependencies (can Agent 2 start yet?)

### Weekly Review:

- [ ] How many tasks completed?
- [ ] Any blockers?
- [ ] Need to adjust priorities?
- [ ] Update time estimates

---

## 🚨 Important Rules

### DO:
✅ **Work sequentially within phases** - Don't skip tasks
✅ **Test after each change** - Don't break existing features
✅ **Check dependencies** - Agent 2 must wait for Agent 1
✅ **Update dashboard** - Keep it current
✅ **Commit frequently** - Small, focused commits

### DON'T:
❌ **Don't skip security fixes** - These are critical
❌ **Don't refactor insecure code** - Agent 2 should wait
❌ **Don't modify shared files simultaneously** - Coordinate
❌ **Don't ignore tests** - Write tests for new code

## 📝 Working with AI Agents

If you're using AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.):

### Setup Each Agent:

**Agent 1 Prompt:**
```
You are Agent 1: Security & Infrastructure Specialist for MSS project.

Your tasks are in AGENT1_TASKS.md. Work through them sequentially.

Current priority: Complete security audit and SQL injection fixes.

When you complete a task:
1. Make the code changes
2. Test them
3. Check off in agent-dashboard.html
4. Report completion

Let's start with Phase 1, Task 1: Audit SQL queries in web/database.py
```

**Agent 2 Prompt:**
```
You are Agent 2: Code Quality & Refactoring Specialist.

⚠️ WAIT: You must wait for Agent 1 to complete:
- SQL injection fixes
- Session management improvements

Until then, you can:
- Set up testing infrastructure
- Start exception handling improvements
- Plan blueprint structure

Your tasks are in AGENT2_TASKS.md
```

**Agent 3 Prompt:**
```
You are Agent 3: Features & Enhancements Specialist.

You can work independently! No dependencies.

Start with quick wins:
1. Add loading states (2h)
2. Improve error messages (2h)
3. Add form validation (2h)

Your tasks are in AGENT3_TASKS.md
```

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

### Morning:
1. Open dashboard
2. Review completed tasks
3. Check if Agent 2 can start (if Agent 1 is done)
4. Plan today's tasks

### During Work:
1. Work on tasks sequentially
2. Check off as you complete
3. Test changes
4. Commit frequently

### End of Day:
1. Export progress (backup)
2. Review blockers
3. Plan tomorrow
4. Update team (if applicable)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't know where to start"
→ Start with Agent 1, Phase 1, Task 1

### "Task seems too complex"
→ Break it down, or ask for help/clarification

### "I broke something"
→ Check git history, revert, test before continuing

### "Dashboard isn't loading"
→ Open the HTML file directly in browser

### "Agent 2 can't start"
→ Check Agent 1 critical tasks are done:
- SQL injection fixes
- Session management
