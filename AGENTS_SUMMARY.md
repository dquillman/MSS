## 🎯 Next Steps for Each Agent

1. **Agent 1** → Apply Pydantic models to all POST endpoints
2. **Agent 3** → Complete database test suite, start integration tests
3. **Agent 4** → Add caching to topic generation, set up Celery
4. **Agent 5** → Document auth/video endpoints, start frontend improvements
5. **Agent 2** → Start blueprint refactoring (after Agent 1 Phase 1 complete)

## 🔄 How to Continue

Each agent has detailed task files:
- `AGENT1_SECURITY_TASKS.md`
- `AGENT2_ARCHITECTURE_TASKS.md`
- `AGENT3_TESTING_TASKS.md`
- `AGENT4_PERFORMANCE_TASKS.md`
- `AGENT5_FEATURES_TASKS.md`

Continue working through each agent's tasks in parallel sessions or sequentially.
