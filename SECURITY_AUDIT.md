## SQL Query Audit

### Query #1: `create_user()` - Line ~99
```python
cursor.execute('''
    INSERT INTO users (email, password_hash, username)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?)
''', (email, password_hash, username or email.split('@')[0]))
```
**Status:** ✅ SAFE - Uses parameterized queries (`?` placeholders)

---

### Query #2: `verify_user()` - Line ~115
[Need to check this function]

---

### Query #3: `create_session()` - Line ~140
[Need to check this function]

---

### Query #4: `get_session()` - Line ~160
[Need to check this function]

---

## Findings

### Secure Queries (Using Parameterization):
- [ ] `create_user()` - Uses `?` placeholders ✅

### Vulnerable Queries (String Formatting):
- [ ] Add any found here

### Actions Required:
1. [ ] Fix any queries using string formatting
2. [ ] Test all queries with SQL injection attempts
3. [ ] Document fixes

---

## SQL Injection Test Cases

Test these inputs to verify security:
```python
# Test 1: Basic injection
email = "test' OR '1'='1"
password = "anything"

# Test 2: Comment injection
email = "test'--"
password = "anything"

# Test 3: Union injection
email = "test' UNION SELECT * FROM users--"
password = "anything"
```

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete audit of all `execute()` calls
2. Fix any vulnerable queries
3. Test fixes
4. Move to Phase 1, Task 2
