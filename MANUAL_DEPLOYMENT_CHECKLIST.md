- Watch these steps:
  1. ‚úÖ Checkout code
  2. ‚úÖ Set up Python
  3. ‚úÖ Authenticate to Google Cloud
  4. ‚è≥ Build Docker image (3-5 minutes - THIS TAKES TIME)

## What to Expect

### Timeline:
- **0-1 min:** Setup (fast)
- **1-6 min:** Building Docker image (SLOWEST part)
- **6-8 min:** Pushing image
- **8-10 min:** Deploying to Cloud Run
- **10 min:** Done! ‚úÖ

### Success Indicators:
- ‚úÖ Green checkmark on all steps
- ‚úÖ "Get service URL" shows a URL
- ‚úÖ "Health check" passes
- ‚úÖ `/healthz` returns version 5.5.7

## Troubleshooting

### If It Fails:

**"Failed to authenticate"**
- Check `GCP_SA_KEY` secret has complete JSON
- Verify `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` is correct

**"Artifact Registry not found"**
- Verify `mss` repository exists in `us-central1`
- Check `GCP_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY` secret = `mss`

**"Cloud Run deployment failed"**
- Check service account has "Cloud Run Admin" role
- Verify `GCP_PROJECT_ID` = `mss-tts`

**"Health check failed"**
- Click on the failed step to see error details
- Check Cloud Run logs in Google Cloud Console

## After Deployment Succeeds

1. **Save your URL** - you'll need it!
2. **Test the endpoints:**
   - `/healthz` - should return version 5.5.7
   - `/auth` - login page
   - `/studio` - MSS Studio interface
3. **Bookmark it!** - This is your production MSS URL
