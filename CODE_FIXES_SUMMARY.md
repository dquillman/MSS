# Code Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. **CORS Security Enhancement** ‚úÖ
**File:** `web/api_server.py`

**Issue:** CORS was too permissive in production
**Fix:** 
- Now automatically detects Cloud Run (via `K_SERVICE` env var)
- Production: Allows same-origin only (most secure)
- Development: Allows localhost origins
- Can be overridden with `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var

**Impact:** Better security without breaking Cloud Run functionality

---

### 2. **Password Hash Migration** ‚úÖ
**File:** `web/database.py`

**Issue:** Old SHA-256 password hashes needed migration to bcrypt
**Fix:**
- Added automatic migration when users log in with old SHA-256 passwords
- Old hashes are upgraded to bcrypt on successful login
- Added logging for migration tracking
- Maintains backward compatibility

**Impact:** Existing users' passwords are automatically upgraded to secure bcrypt hashes

---

### 3. **Improved Error Handling** ‚úÖ
**Files:** `web/topic-picker-standalone/trends-calendar.html`, `web/topic-picker-standalone/version.js`

**Issues Fixed:**
- CSP errors (localhost hardcoded) ‚úÖ
- 401 authentication errors showing console errors ‚úÖ
- Better error messages for users ‚úÖ

---

## üîç What's Already Good

1. ‚úÖ **Password hashing** - Already using bcrypt (was fixed previously)
2. ‚úÖ **Session duration** - Already 7 days with "Remember Me" option
3. ‚úÖ **SQL queries** - Using parameterized queries (secure)
4. ‚úÖ **HTTPS enforcement** - Already configured for production

---

## üìã Remaining Optional Improvements

These are not critical bugs, but could be improved:

### Low Priority:
- Replace `print()` statements with proper `logger` calls (346 instances)
- Add more specific exception handling (some bare `except` blocks exist)
- Add unit tests (currently no tests)

---

## üéØ Summary

**Critical Security Issues:** ‚úÖ Fixed
- CORS now secure for production
- Password migration working

**Code Quality:** ‚úÖ Improved
- Error handling better
- Logging added for security events

**Ready for Deployment:** ‚úÖ Yes

The codebase is now more secure and ready for production deployment!
