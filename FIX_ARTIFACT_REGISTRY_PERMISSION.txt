FIX ARTIFACT REGISTRY PERMISSION:

The service account needs "Artifact Registry Writer" role.

DO THIS:

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=mss-tts

2. Find: mss-tts@mss-tts.iam.gserviceaccount.com

3. Click the pencil icon (edit) next to it

4. Click "+ ADD ANOTHER ROLE"

5. Select: "Artifact Registry Writer"

6. Click "SAVE"

7. Wait 30 seconds for permissions to propagate

8. Re-run the GitHub Actions workflow

That's it! The service account will then have permission to push Docker images.
