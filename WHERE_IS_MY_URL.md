# üîç Where to Find Your MSS URL

## The URL is in the "Get service URL" Step

### Where to Look:

1. **In GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/dquillman/MSS/actions
   - Click on the **most recent workflow run** (the one you just triggered)
   - Scroll down through the steps
   - Look for step named: **"Get service URL"**
   - Click on it to expand
   - You'll see: `Service deployed at: https://mss-api-XXXXX-uc.a.run.app`

### OR

2. **Check Workflow Status:**
   - Is it still running? (Yellow circle = still working, wait longer)
   - Did it fail? (Red X = error, click to see what went wrong)
   - Did it succeed? (Green checkmark = done, look for the step)

---

## If Workflow is Still Running:

- **Yellow circle** = Still working (normal, takes 5-10 minutes)
- **Steps to wait for:**
  - ‚úÖ Checkout code
  - ‚úÖ Set up Python
  - ‚úÖ Authenticate to Google Cloud
  - ‚è≥ **Build Docker image** (THIS TAKES 3-5 MINUTES - LONGEST STEP)
  - ‚è≥ Push Docker image
  - ‚è≥ Deploy to Cloud Run
  - ‚úÖ Get service URL ‚Üê **URL APPEARS HERE**
  - ‚úÖ Health check

**If you see "Build Docker image" still running, just wait!**

---

## If Workflow Completed:

### Green Checkmark = Success!
1. **Scroll down** through all the steps
2. Find step: **"Get service URL"**
3. Click on it to expand
4. Look for text: `Service deployed at: https://...`
5. **Copy that URL!**

### Red X = Failed
1. Click on the **failed step** (red X)
2. Scroll down to see error message
3. Tell me what error you see - I'll help fix it

## Alternative: Get URL from Google Cloud Console

If you can't find it in GitHub:

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/run
2. Make sure project is **`mss-tts`**
3. Look for service: **`mss-api`**
4. Click on it
5. The URL is shown at the top

---

## Quick Check:

**Tell me:**
1. What color is the circle/X? (Yellow, Green, or Red?)
2. What's the last step that completed?
3. Is "Build Docker image" still running?

I'll tell you exactly what to do next!
