## 🚀 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Hook Templates** (`scripts/video_utils.py`, `scripts/make_video.py`)

**Added viral hook patterns:**
- "I analyzed [number] [things] and discovered [shocking finding]..."
- "Most [people/creators] don't know this about [topic]..."
- "After [experiment/research], I found [surprising result]..."
- "This [number] [unit] secret changed everything..."
- "[Bold claim] - Here's why nobody tells you this..."

**Features:**
- Hooks must create curiosity gap (tease without revealing)
- A/B testing support with 3 hook options per topic
- Automatic hook extraction for testing

### 2. **Engagement CTAs** (`scripts/video_utils.py`, `scripts/make_video.py`)

**Specific engagement requests added:**
- "Drop a comment telling me [specific question related to topic]"
- "Like this video if you want more secrets about [related topic]"
- "Subscribe if you want to see [next video idea related to this topic]"
- "Share this with one person who needs to see this"

**Implementation:**
- Automatically appended to narration if not already included
- Stored separately for tracking and analysis
- Context-aware (related to video topic)

**Story Arc Structure:**

## 📊 How to Use

### Basic Usage (All Enhancements Enabled)

```bash
python scripts/topics_to_video.py
```

This will:

2. Use viral hook patterns
3. Include engagement CTAs
4. Optimize for SEO
5. Integrate trending topics (if API key set)

### Disable Meta-Content (if needed)

Edit `scripts/make_video.py`:
```python
topics = openai_generate_topics(brand, seed="", include_meta_content=False)
```

### Customize Hook Patterns

Edit `scripts/video_utils.py` in `get_enhanced_script_prompt()` to add/modify hook patterns.

### Monitor Performance

Use `scripts/analytics.py` to track:
- CTR (target >5%)
- Average view duration (target >50%)
- Retention at 30 seconds (target >70%)
