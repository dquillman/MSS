# How to Find GitHub Actions

## Steps to Access GitHub Actions

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
   - Open your browser
   - Navigate to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MSS`
   - (Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)

2. **Click on the "Actions" tab**
   - Look at the top of the repository page
   - You'll see tabs: `Code`, `Issues`, `Pull requests`, **`Actions`**, `Projects`, etc.
   - Click on **`Actions`**

3. **View Workflows**
   - You'll see a list of workflows on the left
   - Look for: **"Build and Deploy to Google Cloud Run"**
   - Click on it to see workflow runs

4. **View Latest Run**
   - Click on the most recent workflow run
   - You'll see all the steps (Checkout, Build, Deploy, etc.)
   - Watch the progress in real-time

## Manual Trigger (If Needed)

If the workflow didn't start automatically:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on **"Build and Deploy to Google Cloud Run"** on the left
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button (top right)
4. Select branch: `master` or `main`
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

## What to Look For

After clicking Actions, you should see:
- ✅ Green checkmark = Successful deployment
- ⏳ Yellow circle = Currently running
- ❌ Red X = Failed (click to see error details)

The service URL will be shown in the "Get service URL" step if successful.
